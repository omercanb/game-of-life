 Conway's Game of Life
 
 Press space to advance a turn or 's' to autoadvance and use arrow keys to pan.
 Change the parameters of the grower and the board for different sized starting cells.
 
 To calculate which cells are alive after a turn, numpy array masks are used instead of an iterative appraoch for optimization.
